He was instructed to follow-up with his outpatient\\npsychiatrist (he will need to have an appointment made at\\nrehab).\\n.\\n# chronic diastolic CHF with MR - Patient appeared euvolemic on\\nadmissiom.  His BNP was 734.  His home dose of lasix was\\ncontinued.  He was noted to have recurrent hypokalemia in the\\nsetting of vigorous diuresis, for which he received potassium\\nsupplementation (80meq daily).  He was restarted on his home\\nregimen of potassium repletion as below, and his potassium\\nshould be checked on [**2145-9-10**] and his potassium should be\\nrepleted as needed.\\n.\\n# Lower Extremity Skin Changes - He has chronic lower extremity\\nvenous stasis ulcers.  A small ulcer noted on L LE, with\\nserosanguinous drainage, without evidence of infection.  This\\nwas treated with dry gauze dressing and lidex, changed once\\ndaily, elevation of the lower extremities when in bed, and lasix\\nas above.\\n.\\nIn addition, pt has a chronic wound on his left cheek from\\npicking at it, that oozes frequently.  Dressing changes and\\nwound care were provided by his nurses.\\n.\\n# hypokalemia - pt on chronic potassium repletion as an\\noutpatient, which was held initially, then restarted in setting\\nof hypokalemia above.\\n.\\n# h/o Afib - Patient was not in A-fib on this admission.  He is\\ncurrently off his nodal agents.  He was started on lovenox while\\nbeing bridged to coumadin.  His INR remained subtherapeutic, and\\nhis coumadin dose was therfore increased from 6mg qdaily to\\n7.5mg po qdaily, with a single dose of 10mg given on [**2145-9-8**].\\nHe should continue lovenox until therapeutic INR ([**2-16**]) is\\nacheived.\\n.\\n# h/o AVR - Patient was started on lovenox while being bridged\\nto coumadin as above.

Located within the atrium of the right\\nlateral ventricle is an 18 x 10 mm nodular area of increased\\ndensity which is separate from the choroid plexus. There is no\\nevidence of surrounding edema. There is diffuse brain atrophy\\nand chronic microvascular infarction throughout the white\\nmatter. There is a remote right frontal infarct. There is no\\nevidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute major vascular\\nterritorial infarction. The ventricles do not appear dilated\\nrelative to the sulci, and there is no shift of normally midline\\nstructures. There is no skull fracture.

Pleural fluid cytology was consistent with poorly\\ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma. CT showed a moderate amount of\\nintra-abdominal ascites and enhancing nodularity within the\\nperitoneal/omental fat consistent with carcinomatosis/omental\\ncaking. CA-125 was elevated at 909. On [**2167-12-23**] she underwent a\\nthoracoscopy with pleurodesis, biopsy of the left parietal\\npleura and right percutaneous drainage of pleural effusion.\\nThere was bulky metastatic disease within the pleural space. She\\nstarted carboplatin and paclitaxel on [**2167-12-31**]. After 3 cycles,\\nshe underwent surgical debulking and TAH/BSO by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] on\\n[**2168-3-31**]. She was optimally debulked and had minimal residual\\ndisease. She received 3 additional cycles of carboplatin/taxol\\npost-operatively, last treatment on [**2168-6-15**]. Her CA 125 started\\ntrending up in [**4-3**]. CT torso in [**6-3**] was notable for a right\\nsided pleural effusion which was malignant based on cytology\\nfrom thoracentesis on [**2169-7-28**]. She started carboplatin/taxol\\nagain on [**2169-8-17**]. She had recurrent pleural effusion and\\nunderwent thoracentesis on [**2169-9-14**] and again in [**12-6**]. She\\nunderwent talc pleurodesis on [**2170-1-10**]. CT on [**2170-2-14**] showed new\\nmediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as\\nmarkedly increased soft tissue thickening along the right\\npleura, extending into the anterior mediastinum. She started\\nDoxil on [**2170-2-21**]. She stopped after 7 cycles because her CA 125\\nrose and her CT was unchanged. She was given a chemotherapy\\nbreak. However, she developed rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy\\nin her neck in 11/[**2169**]. She started Navelbine 30mg/m2 on\\n[**2170-11-1**]. She received D1 and D8 doses, but was neutropenic on\\nD15.\\n.\\nNavelbine was dose reduced to 25mg/m2 during her second cycle,\\nbut she again became neutropenic and the D15 dose was held. Her\\nregimen was changed to Navelbine 30mg/m2 on D1 and D15 of a 28\\nday cycle and each dose is being followed with neulasta. Her\\nCA-125 decreased from 340 to 167 after 3 cycles, but then rose\\nto 273 in early 3/[**2170**]. Vaginal biopsy on [**2171-2-21**] performed due\\nto vaginal bleeding was notable for metastatic poorly\\ndifferentiated carcinoma. Patient started gemcitabine C1 D1 on\\n[**2171-10-3**]. She completed 4 cycles of gemcitabine until having\\nher dose held on [**2172-1-23**] due to concern of either progression\\nof disease or gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity causing.

Her hospital\\ncourse, which now spans nearly one month, has had multiple\\ncomplications, including bilateral PEs, now s/p IVC stent, Afib\\nwith RVR, gastrointestinal bleed, slowly resolving partial bowel\\nobstruction, acute kidney injury, and complicated UTI.\\n.\\n# Pericardial effusion: Large effusion seen on echo which was\\ndrained - 650cc bloody fluid; shortness of breath vastly\\nimproved following the dranaige in the ICU, and she was\\ntransferred to the OMED floor on [**5-29**] as a result. Gram stain/cx\\nof the fluid showed POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES and the fluid\\nculture was negative for acid fast bacteria. The fluid had many\\nwhite blood cells and atypical cells indicating mailignant\\norigin. CT scan of chest [**5-27**]: the small size of the right\\natrium, if not due to hypovolemia, may indicate constrictive\\nphysiology. Repeat Echo on [**6-2**] showed no significant\\nreaccumulation of pericardial fluid, however showed right heart\\nstrain.\\n\\n# Bilateral PEs: Because of the evidence of right heart strain\\non Echo, CTA was done to r/o PE's. On CTA  ([**6-2**]) the patient was\\nfound to have bilateral segmental PE's, as a result heparin drip\\nwas started after testing stool guiac which was negative. IVC\\nstent was subsequently placed without any complications. Heparin\\nwas stopped in the setting of guaiac positive stool. ASA 81mg\\nwas started for anticoagulation prophylaxis.\\n.\\n# Pleural effusions:  Bilateral chronic effusions. Has had 2\\npleurodeses in the past. The follwing CT findings were seen on\\nCT chest [**5-27**]: 1. Progressive consolidation of the right lung,\\nsparing only the apex and obscuring previous tumor infiltration\\nis probably due to restrictive effects of circumferential right\\npleural thickening, partially calcified following pleurodesis.\\n2. Despite a small residual pericardial effusion, and the\\nindwelling pericardial drain, the small size of the right\\natrium, if not due to hypovolemia, may indicate constrictive\\nphysiology. Clinical correlation is needed. Since the patient\\nwas symptomatically improved with good oxygen saturations\\nfollowing the pericardiocentesis, it was deduced that the\\npleural effusions were not a significant contributor to her\\npresenting complaints. The pleural effusions remained stable\\nthroughout the remainder of her hospitalization.\\n.\\n# GI bleed: Downtrending Hct in the setting of blood clots\\nfollowing an enema were concerning for GI bleed. Lovenox, which\\nwas started in the setting of PE, was changed to Heparin. GI was\\nconsulted, who recommended that heparin be discontinued and that\\nno further anticoagulation be given. Aspirin was started for\\nanticoagulation in the setting of Afib as recommended by\\nCardiology.\\n.\\n# AFib with RVR: The patient triggered on [**6-2**] for heart rate in\\nthe 160-170 and found to have atrial fibrillation. She was\\neffectively rate controlled with IV lopressor pushes. She\\nsubsequently had several more episodes of Afib with RVR that\\nwere precipitated by sitting up and moving to the cammode; she\\nresponded to lopressor pushes. She was started on PO metoprolol\\ntartrate, which was titrated to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] based on the\\nrecommendations of a cardiology consult. Cardiology diagnosed\\nher arrhythmia as asymptomatic episodic paroxysmal atrial\\nfibrillation, requiring no intervention with antiarrhythmic\\nmedications because she spontaneously converts on her own and\\nonly gentle rate control. Due to repeated episodes of\\nasymptomatic tachycardia due to afib, she was taken off of\\ntelemetry monitoring per cardiology.\\n.\\n# Partial bowel obstruction: Over the course of the\\nhospitalization, she developed a partial bowel obstruction -\\npresenting with a tense, tender abdomen, abdominal pain, and\\nnausea. GI was consulted who diagnosed the partial obstruction\\nand bleeding as being due to invasion of the colonic wall by her\\ncancer. She was made NPO and her diet was gently advanced to\\nclears. A KUB was obtained, which ruled out perforation and\\nshowed significant constipation. Supportive laxatives were given\\norally and rectally daily, but to no significant avail. To date\\nshe has had fewer than 5 bowel movements, which have been watery\\nand loose. She continues to tolerate a conservative full clear\\nliquid diet without any abdominal pain or nausea.\\n.\\n# Anemia: Was transfused 2 units [**6-1**] in effort to increase\\nhemoglobin in the setting of sinus tachycardia and blood clots\\nper rectum.\\n.\\n# Bacteremia: The patient had gram positive cocci growing in\\nclusters, coagulase negative which grew in her blood from\\nculture sample taken from her port on [**6-2**]. Most probably a\\ncontaminant since the patient had no leukocytosis, fevers, or\\nother clinical signs of an infection. No signs of infection at\\nher port either. The patient had also grown staph. bacteria\\ncoagulase negative from urine culture taken [**6-3**]. This bacteremia\\ncould be caused by infected port even though the port site does\\nnot have any erythema or fluctuation. It also could still be\\ncontamination because of no clinical signs of fever or\\nleukocytosis. Started and currently continuing Vancomycin as a\\nprecaution ([**6-4**]).  We took another blood sample from her port on\\n[**6-4**], to reassess. Subsequent cultures were negative and\\nantibiotics were discontinued.\\n.\\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: Developed elevated creatinine suggestive of pre-renal\\n[**Last Name (un) **], which resolved to her baseline with supportive IVF.\\n.\\n# Complicated UTI: Developed a UTI in the setting of a recent\\nindwelling urinary catheter. She was treated with Cipro and sent\\nhome with 1 day of antibiotics for a total course of 10 days.\\n.\\n# Peritoneal carcinoma: Failed multiple treatments including two\\ncycles of alimta.

Several imaging studies showed fluid around your\\nheart. This fluid was successfully drained without complication\\nand your diffuculty breathing improved. Radiographic imaging\\nalso showed fluid accumulating in your chest cavity, known as\\npleural effusions. These fluid collections remained stable and\\nwere not thought to be contributing significantly to your\\nshortness of breath because your symptoms improved after\\ndraining fluid from  around your heart.\\n.\\nFurther radiographic imaging of your chest showed clots in both\\nlungs. To prevent further clots, you were started on an\\nanticoagulation medication, but at a low dose because blood\\nclots observed in your rectum raised concern for\\ngastrointestinal bleeding. Due to the risk of bleeding presented\\nby increasing the anticoagulation medication in the setting of a\\nsuspected gastrointestinal bleed, the decision was made to place\\na filter in your inferior vena cava instead - the inferior vena\\ncava is a major vein feeding blood into the heart. This was done\\nto prevent further clots from being pumped into your lungs. This\\nprocedure was successfully completed and the decision was made\\nto stop the anticoagulation medication and to start a\\nconservative, safe dose of aspirin in its place.\\n.\\nDuring your hospitalization, you developed several bouts of\\nrapid heart rate found to be caused by an irregular heart rhythm\\nknown as atrial fibrillation. The episodes were controlled with\\na medication that slows the heart rate to safe levels known as\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology specialists saw you in the hospital and\\ndiagnosed your heart rhythm as intermittent paroxysmal atrial\\nfibrillation, which is a rhythm that often causes patients who\\nhave it no symptoms and which corrects itself. Given this\\ndiagnosis and that you experienced no symptoms from the rhythm,\\nwe stopped 24h monitoring of your heart based on the\\nrecommendations of our cardiac colleagues. We will be\\ndischarging you on metoprolol.\\n.\\nDue, in part, to your progressive peritoneal cancer, you\\ndeveloped a partial bowel obstruction during this\\nhospitalization. Radiographic imaging showed no evidence of a\\ncomplete bowel obstruction or evidence of a hole in your bowel,\\nbut did show that you were quite backed up with stool.\\nAggressive bowel regimens were given to you by mouth and per\\nrectum with mixed success. You continued to pass gas per rectum\\nover the course of the hospitalization, but you only had\\nintermittent watery bowel movements. In addition, you had\\nseveral episodes of abdominal pain without associated nausea,\\nwhich were partially relieved with IV and oral morphine. After\\nthese episodes, we made your diet order nothing per mouth (NPO)\\nand slowly advanced your nutrition as tolerated. We were very\\nconservative in advancing your diet because you have not had a\\nsizable bowel movement for some time now; you will be discharged\\non an agressive bowel regimen by mouth and per rectum and on a\\nfull liquid diet.\\n.\\nDuring this hospitalization, your kidneys showed temporary signs\\nof dehydration, but this resolved with intravenous fluid.\\n.\\nYou were also found to have a suspected urinary tract infection,\\nwhich was treated with oral antibiotics. You will be discharged\\non this antibiotic to complete a total 10 day course.\\n.\\nOther than what is detailed below, no changes were made to your\\noutpatient medication regimen.\\n# NEW: Ciprofloxacin 500mg 2x daily x 2 days (last day [**2172-6-24**])\\n# NEW: Metoprolol 50mg 2x daily\\n# NEW: Aspirin 81mg daily\\n# NEW: Bisacodyl 10 mg per rectum daily as needed for\\nconstipation\\n# NEW: Lactulose 30 mL by mouth every 8h as needed for\\nconstipation\\n# NEW: Polyethylene Glycol 17g by mouth 2x daily\\n# NEW: Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr transdermal patch replaced every 72h\\n# NEW: Morphine Sulfate (Oral Soln.) 10-20 mg by mouth every 2h\\nas needed for pain\\n# NEW: Ipratropium Bromide 1 NEB inhaled every 6h\\n\\n.\\n# INCREASED TO: Metoclopramide 10 mg every 6h as needed for\\nnausea\\n# DECREASED TO: Ondansetron HCl 4 mg 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every\\n8h as needed for nausea\\n.\\n# STOPPED: HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 4 mg [**11-30**] Tablet(s) by mouth\\n2very 4-6 hours as needed for pain\\n# STOPPED: Dexamethasone 4 mg one Tablet(s) by mouth twice a\\nday; the day before, the day of and the day after chemotherapy\\n# STOPPED: Dicyclomine 10 mg 2 Capsule(s) by mouth four times a\\nday\\n# STOPPED: Docusate Sodium as needed for constipation\\n# STOPPED: Senna as needed for constipation\\n# STOPPED: Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet, 2 Tablet(s) by mouth daily as\\nneeded for constipation\\n# STOPPED: Folic acid 1mg daily\\n.\\nThe following medications were not changed:\\n# UNCHANGED: Codeine-Guaifenesin 100 mg-10 mg/5 mL\\n# UNCHANGED: Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg every 8h as needed for anxiety\\n# UNCHANGED: Prochlorperazine Maleate 10 mg Tablet 1 Tablet PO\\nevery six (6) hours as needed for nausea.\\n\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\n[**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD\\nOffice Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5562**]\\nOffice Location: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 9\\nDivision: Hematology/Oncology\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 576,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\n    \\\"clinical_findings\\\": {\\n        \\\"B20\\\": [\\n            {\\n                \\\"icd_10_cm_code\\\": \\\"B20\\\",\\n                \\\"icd_10_cm_code_description\\\": \\\"Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease\\\",\\n                \\\"Monitoring\\\": [],\\n                \\\"Evaluation\\\": [],\\n                \\\"Assessment\\\": [],\\n                \\\"Treatment\\\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"text\\\": \\\"Lamivudine 300 mg p.o. q.d.\\\",\\n                        \\\"page_numbers\\\": [\\n                            1\\n                        ]\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"text\\\": \\\"Didanosine EC 400 mg p.o. q.p.m.\\\",\\n                        \\\"page_numbers\\\": [\\n                            1\\n                        ]\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"text\\\": \\\"Lopinavir three caps p.o. b.i.d.\\\",\\n                        \\\"page_numbers\\\": [\\n                            1\\n                        ]\\n                    }\\n                ],\\n                \\\"condition_evidence\\\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"evidence_text\\\": \\\"HIV\\\",\\n                        \\\"page_numbers\\\": [\\n                            1\\n                        ]\\n                    },\\n                    {\\n                        \\\"evidence_text\\\": \\\"HIV\\\",\\n                        \\\"page_numbers\\\": [\\n                            1\\n                        ]\\n                    }\\n                ],\\n                \\\"justification\\\": \\\"ICD-10-CM code B20 is assigned for HIV disease.
